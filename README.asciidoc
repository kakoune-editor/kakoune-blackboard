kakoune-blackboard
==================

This project implements a plugin for https://github.com/gawel/irc3[irc3]
that allows executing arbitrary keys on a given piece of text in
https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[Kakoune].

Instructions
------------

Setup
~~~~~

Python 3 is required to run the bot.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kakoune-editor/kakoune-blackboard.git
$ cd kakoune-blackboard
```

The recommended way to run the bot is by setting up a virtual environment,
but this step is optional:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file, either manually
or using the `pip` package manager:

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the `kakoune_blackboard.cfg` file to tune the various settings according
to your needs: bot identity, network, channels etc.

Running
~~~~~~~

Use the following command to start the bot:

```sh
$ irc3 kakoune_blackboard.cfg
```

Refer to the documentation of `irc3` to learn more about additional flags
(e.g. `-d` for debugging).

You can also deploy an image in https://www.docker.com/[Docker] using the
`Dockerfile` provided in this repository. After you've modified the
configuration file, run the following commands:

```sh
$ docker build -t ${USER}/kakoune-blackboard .
$ docker run ${USER}/kakoune-blackboard
```
